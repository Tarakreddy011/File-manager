A Python-based media organizer script that automatically sorts photos, videos, and other files into separate folders using smart file detection and safe-moving logic. Supports recursive scanning, auto-renaming, and works across all operating systems.
🚀 How It Works
User enters the directory path.
The program scans through all files—including subfolders.
The script checks file extensions and categorizes them:
1.Photos → Photos/
2.Videos → Videos/
3.Others → Others/
4.Files are safely moved (renamed when required).
